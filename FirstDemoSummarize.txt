Software failed to run after first compile.
After writing some tests it came out, that FreeBooksHub is not correctly computed. The result is always 0 titles.
Every query (in every day) results with the same titles. It's because links list most popular books, not newest ones.
Starting points in main methods links to hardcoded paths with username account.
Meny fields are public - major refactor needed.
Mane paths in the code links to file with "IdeaProject/src/..." - they won't work after compile on another machine.
Lots of calculations is placed in constructors, including connections.
Strange style, lack of else statement.
Mistakes in value names, against convention.
Packages starting from capital letters.
In logger you can find weird information (eg. "dupa").
Poor error handling - most of exceptions are catch with "Exception e".
No tests.
No connection timeout.
Unmaintainable database, based on some strange strings pattern using break lines as separator in several occasion.
No readme file.
No documentation.
Some trashes in database.
Maven version of java = 1.0.
Memory leakages, lots of them.
Lack of clean code.
somewhere you can find logger.fatal - but it is simple error.
Project didn't leave IDE - all paths links to sources.
Lots of ineffective string concatenations. Every operation logging books require computing strings concatenation with simple "+" operator.

Estimated finish time - two weeks.
